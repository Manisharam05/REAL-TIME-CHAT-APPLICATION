This project is a Real-Time Chat Application built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS with a modern, responsive UI. It features a sidebar for conversations, a chat window for real-time messaging, and user avatars with online/offline status. Messages are displayed in styled chat bubbles with timestamps and read indicators.

The application uses custom React components and hooks to manage chat state, message sending, and conversation selection. A mock data system simulates real-time replies, making it suitable for demonstrations and learning purposes. The design system follows a dark-themed, glassmorphism UI, ensuring a professional and user-friendly chat experience across desktop and mobile devices.
